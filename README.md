# SerenityBDDTest
Testing app on Java with WebDriver, Junit, Serenity BDD

These keyword-driving tests based on trade platform prom.ua with frameworks that I describe before. I have implemented few user stories that could realize acceptance criteria. Got experience in locating different web elements, programing in DSL, writing reusable code. 

 Based on:
 
•	Selenium WebDriver

•	JUnit

•	Serenity BDD

•	Maven

•	XPath 

•	Page Object pattern
